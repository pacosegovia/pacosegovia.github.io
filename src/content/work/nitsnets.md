[Nitsnets](http://nitsnets.com) is the most prominent online study platform for competitive exams in Spain, with over a million students and an incredible team. It is located in A Coru√±a (Spain). I joined the company when there were just over 10 employees and left when they had around 50.

My role here involved building the interface for both the public website and the private area where students took tests. I also contributed to the creation of a design system, both on the UI and development fronts, establishing the necessary structure for scalability over time.
