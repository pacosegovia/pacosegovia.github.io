[RedRadix](http://redradix.com) is a Madrid-based company that provides design and technology services to other businesses, helping them build their digital products.

My role here is primarily as a UI engineer, assisting other companies in constructing their products. It was a wild change for me to transition from a product-focused company to a service-oriented one, but the variety of projects and technologies I engage with on a daily basis greatly contribute to my professional growth. Additionally, skills such as project management and client relations become increasingly important. I typically work with Next.js or create stores with Shopify.

Here, I've been involved in projects for clients such as F.C. Barcelona, Meli√° Hotels, and GitHub.
